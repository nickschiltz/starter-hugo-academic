More than one-third of all adults have multiple chronic health conditions (multimorbidity), and about 15% are taking five or more drugs concurrently (polypharmacy). Despite this high prevalence, most research and treatment guidelines are single-disease and/or single-treatment focused. In this research project, we use modern data mining methods to identify specific combinations of polypharmacy that influence health outcomes and expenditures.  Further, we seek to model jointly the impact of multimorbidity and polypharmacy on patient-reported quality of life measures and medical expenditures using machine-learning methods of classification trees and random forest. This project uses the nationally-representative Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, which has prescription drug and medical condition data in over 116,000 adults.
