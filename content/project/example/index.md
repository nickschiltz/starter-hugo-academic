This project involves using identifying combinations and sequences of multimorbidity that occur in the population. We use association rule learning techniques on large healthcare datasets including the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and the Health and Retirement Study linked to Medicare claims. 

While it is well known that many adults suffer from multiple chronic conditions, the incidence and prevalence of specific combinations of disease has not been fully examined. Using population surveys, our lab seeks to identify and quantify the prevalence of the most common 2-way, 3-way, 4-way, etc... combinations of multimorbidity. Better understanding of the scope of the problem, can help identify research priorities for public health interventions and evidence-based research.
