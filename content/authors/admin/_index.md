Dr. Schiltz is an Assistant Professor at the Frances Payne Bolton School of Nursing at Case Western Reserve University, with secondary appointments in Population & Quantitative Health Science and the Center for Community Health Integration. His expertise involves applying modern methods in data science to study patients with complex chronic disease, utilizing large health care databases including medical claims, hospital data, registry data, vital statistics, and national surveys. Some of his current research projects include using data mining and machine learning to identify patterns of comorbidity and polypharmacy in the population, and developing a point-of-service clinical tool to predict patients at high risk of developing opioid use disorder.
