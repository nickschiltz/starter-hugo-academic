abstract: 'Purpose To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of multiparametric diagnostic
  magnetic resonance (MR) imaging examination followed by MR imaging-guided biopsy
  strategies in the detection of prostate cancer in biopsy-naive men presenting with
  clinical suspicion of cancer for the first time. Materials and Methods A decision-analysis
  model was created for biopsy-naive men who had been recommended for prostate biopsy
  on the basis of abnormal digital rectal examination results or elevated prostate-specific
  antigen levels (age groups: 41-50 years, 51-60 years, and 61-70 years). The following
  three major strategies were evaluated: (a) standard transrectal ultrasonography
  (US)-guided biopsy; (b) diagnostic MR imaging followed by MR imaging-targeted biopsy,
  with no biopsy performed if MR imaging findings were negative; and (c) diagnostic
  MR imaging followed by MR imaging-targeted biopsy, with a standard biopsy performed
  when MR imaging findings were negative. The following three MR imaging-guided biopsy
  strategies were further evaluated in each MR imaging category: (a) biopsy with cognitive
  guidance, (b) biopsy with MR imaging/US fusion guidance, and (c) in-gantry MR imaging-guided
  biopsy. Model parameters were derived from the literature. The primary outcome measure
  was net health benefit (NHB), which was measured as quality-adjusted life-years
  (QALYs) gained or lost by investing resources in a new strategy compared with a
  standard strategy at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $50 000 per QALY gained.
  Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed by using Monte Carlo simulations.
  Results Noncontrast MR imaging followed by cognitively guided MR biopsy (no standard
  biopsy if MR imaging findings were negative) was the most cost-effective approach,
  yielding an additional NHB of 0.198 QALY compared with the standard biopsy approach.
  Noncontrast MR imaging followed by in-gantry MR imaging-guided biopsy (no standard
  biopsy if MR imaging findings were negative) led to the highest NHB gain of 0.251
  additional QALY compared with the standard biopsy strategy. All MR imaging strategies
  were cost-effective in 94.05% of Monte Carlo simulations. Analysis by age groups
  yielded similar results. Conclusion MR imaging-guided strategies for the detection
  of prostate cancer were cost-effective compared with the standard biopsy strategy
  in a decision-analysis model. Â© RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available
