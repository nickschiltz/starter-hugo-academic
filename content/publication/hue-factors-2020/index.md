abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Pancreatectomy is a complex operation with a historic readmission
  rate of approximately 20%. Hospital readmissions lead to increased patient and health
  system costs, morbidity, and mortality making them a topic of great interest. The
  objective of this study was to identify factors associated with readmission after
  pancreatectomy in order to target areas for improvement. METHODS: Pancreatectomy
  procedures for malignancy in adults from 2005 to 2011 were identified in the California
  State Inpatient Database. Descriptive analysis was conducted to evaluate the association
  between baseline variables and readmission status. Logistic regression models were
  developed to determine whether the bivariate associations identified persisted after
  adjusting for patient characteristics. RESULTS: Of the 4262 patients who underwent
  a pancreatectomy, 843 (19.8%) were readmitted within 30 days. Readmission rates
  by year did not vary over the study period. Results from multivariable analysis
  showed that males, Hispanics, Medicare recipients, patients with an initial length
  of stay textgreater11 days, patients who were discharged to a skilled nursing facility,
  and those with chronic anemia were more likely to be readmitted compared to those
  without these characteristics. The majority of readmissions occurred within 15 days
  after discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Readmissions after pancreatectomy are multifactorial.
  Preoperative optimization, minimizing postoperative complications, and assuring
  patients have been evaluated by a multidisciplinary team may reduce the readmission
  rate.'
