abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: To assess long-term direct medical costs, health care utilization,
  and mortality following resective surgery in persons with uncontrolled epilepsy.
  METHODS: Retrospective longitudinal cohort study of Medicaid beneficiaries with
  epilepsy from 2000 to 2008. The study population included 7,835 persons with uncontrolled
  focal epilepsy ages 18-64 years, with an average follow-up time of 5 years. Of these,
  135 received surgery during the study period. To account for selection bias, we
  used risk-set optimal pairwise matching on a time-varying propensity score, and
  inverse probability of treatment weighting. Repeated measures generalized linear
  models were used to model utilization and cost outcomes. Cox proportional hazard
  was used to model survival. RESULTS: The mean direct medical cost difference between
  the surgical group and control group was $6,806 after risk-set matching. The incidence
  rate ratio of inpatient, emergency room, and outpatient utilization was lower among
  the surgical group in both unadjusted and adjusted analyses. There was no significant
  difference in mortality after adjustment. Among surgical cases, mean annual costs
  per subject were on average $6,484 lower, and all utilization measures were lower
  after surgery compared to before. SIGNIFICANCE: Subjects that underwent epilepsy
  surgery had lower direct medical care costs and health care utilization. These findings
  support that epilepsy surgery yields substantial health care cost savings.'
