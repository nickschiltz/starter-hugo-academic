abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that managed care enrollees (MCEs) and
  fee-for-service beneficiaries (FFSBs) have become similar in case-mix over time;
  but comparisons of health outcomes have yielded mixed results. OBJECTIVE: To examine
  changes in differentials between MCEs and FFSBs both in case-mix and health outcomes
  over time. DESIGN: Temporal study of the linked Health and Retirement Study (HRS)
  and Medicare data, comparing case-mix and health outcomes between MCEs and FFSBs
  across 3 time periods: 1992-1998, 1999-2004, and 2005-2011. We used multivariable
  analysis, stratified by, and pooled across the study periods. The unit of analysis
  was the person-wave (n=167,204). SUBJECTS: HRS participants who were also enrolled
  in Medicare. MEASURES: Outcome measures included self-reported fair/poor health,
  2-year self-rated worse health, and 2-year mortality. Our main covariate was a composite
  measure of multimorbidity (MM), MM0-MM3, defined as the co-occurrence of chronic
  conditions, functional limitations, and/or geriatric syndromes. RESULTS: The case-mix
  differential between MCEs and FFSBs persisted over time. Results from multivariable
  models on the pooled data and incorporating interaction terms between managed care
  status and study period indicated that MCEs and FFSBs were as likely to die within
  2 years from the HRS interview (P=0.073). This likelihood remained unchanged across
  the study periods. However, MCEs were more likely than FFSBs to report fair/poor
  health in the third study period (change in probability for the interaction term:
  0.024, P=0.008), but less likely to rate their health worse in the last 2 years,
  albeit at borderline significance (change in probability: -0.021, P=0.059). CONCLUSIONS:
  Despite the persistence of selection bias, the differential in self-reported fair/poor
  status between MCEs and FFSBs seems to be closing over time.'
