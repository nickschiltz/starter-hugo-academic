abstract: "INTRODUCTION: One view of value in medicine is outcome relative to cost\
  \ of care provided. With respect to operative care, increased attention has been\
  \ placed on evaluation and optimization of patients prior to undergoing an elective\
  \ surgery. We examined more than 2 million patients having elective, non-cardiac\
  \ surgery to assess the incidence and utility of pre-operative hemostatic screening,\
  \ compared with a composite of history variables that may indicate a propensity\
  \ for bleeding, to assess several important outcomes of surgery. MATERIALS & METHODS:\
  \ We queried the NSQIP database to identify 2,020,533 patients and compared hemostatic\
  \ tests (PT, aPTT, platelet count) and history covariables indicative of potential\
  \ for abnormal hemostasis. We compared outcomes across predictor values; used Person's\
  \ chi-square tests to compare differences, and logistic regression to model outcomes.\
  \ RESULTS: Approximately 36% of patients had all three tests pre-operatively while\
  \ 16% had none of them; 11.2% had a history predictive of potential abnormal bleeding.\
  \ Outcomes of interest across the cohort included death in 0.7%, unplanned return\
  \ to the operating room or re-admission within 30 days in 3.8% and 6.2% of patients;\
  \ 5.3% received a transfusion during or after surgery. Sub-analyses in each of the\
  \ nine surgical specialties' most common procedures yielded similar results. CONCLUSION:\
  \ The limited predictive value of each hemostatic screening test, as well as excess\
  \ costs associated with them, across a broad spectrum of elective surgeries, suggests\
  \ that limiting pre-operative testing to a more select group of patients may be\
  \ reasonable, equally efficacious, efficient, and cost-effective."
