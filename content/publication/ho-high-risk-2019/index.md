abstract: 'BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Over a million older patients in the United States
  are admitted yearly for emergency general surgery (EGS) conditions. Seven procedure
  types dominate: colon, small bowel, gallbladder, ulcer disease, adhesiolysis, appendix,
  and laparotomy operations. A higher comorbidity burden is known to increase mortality
  in this population, but the impact of specific comorbidity combinations is unknown.
  Our objectives were to (1) characterize the distribution of procedures, comorbidities,
  and outcomes for older patients undergoing EGS; and (2) apply a data-driven approach
  (association rule mining) to identify comorbidity combinations associated with disproportionately
  high mortality. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional study of patients
  65 years and older who underwent one of the seven procedures previously cited, taken
  from the 2011 Nationwide Inpatient Sample. A total of 280 885 patient encounters
  were identified. MEASUREMENTS: In-hospital mortality, procedures, and comorbidities
  based on the Elixhauser Comorbidity Index. RESULTS: Overall mortality was 5.6%.
  The most common procedures were gallbladder (33.7%), ulcer surgery (21.5%), and
  adhesiolysis (21.0%). Mortality increased for all procedures as patients aged. Comorbidities
  associated with the highest mortality included coagulopathy (adjusted odds ratio
  [aOR] = 3.74; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.41-4.11; p textless .001), fluid
  and electrolyte disorders (FED) (aOR = 2.89; 95% CI = 3.66-3.14; p textless .001),
  and liver disease (aOR = 1.89; 95% CI = 1.61-2.22; p textless .001). Three-way comorbidity
  combinations most highly associated with mortality were coagulopathy, FED, and peripheral
  vascular disease (aOR = 5.10; 95% CI = 4.17-6.24; p textless .001), and coagulopathy,
  FED, and chronic pulmonary disease (aOR = 4.83; 95% CI = 4.00-5.82; p textless .001).
  CONCLUSION: For older patients, combinations of comorbidities portend additional
  risk beyond single comorbidities, and the associated risk burden is driven by the
  specific constellation of comorbidities present. Future work must continue to examine
  the effect of co-occurring diseases to provide personalized and realistic prognostication
  for older patients undergoing EGS. J Am Geriatr Soc 67:503-510, 2019.'
