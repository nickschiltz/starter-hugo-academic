abstract: 'STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of the prospectively collected American
  College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement database. OBJECTIVE: We
  assessed whether preoperative cigarette smoking and smoking duration predicted adverse,
  early, perioperative outcomes in patients undergoing elective spine surgery. SUMMARY
  OF BACKGROUND DATA: Prior studies have assessed the association of smoking and long-term
  outcomes for a number of spine surgery procedures, with conflicting findings. The
  association between smoking and 30-day outcomes for spine surgery is unknown. METHODS:
  A total 14,500 adults, classified as current (N = 3914), prior (N = 2057), and never
  smokers. Using propensity scores, current and prior smokers were matched to never
  smokers. Logistic regression was used to predict adverse postoperative outcomes.
  The relationship between pack-years and adverse outcomes was tested. Sensitivity
  analyses were conducted limiting the study sample to patients who underwent spine
  fusion (N = 4663), and using patient subgroups by procedure. RESULTS: In unadjusted
  analyses, prior smokers were significantly more likely to have prolonged hospitalization
  (1.2, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1-1.3) and major complications (1.3, 95% CI:
  1.1-1.6) compared with never smokers. No association was found between smoking status
  and adverse outcomes in adjusted, matched patient models. Current smokers with more
  than 60 pack-years were more likely to die within 30 days of surgery (3.0, 95% CI,
  1.1-7.8), compared with never smokers. Sensitivity analyses confirmed these findings.
  CONCLUSION: The large National Surgical Quality Improvement population was carefully
  matched for a wide range of baseline comorbidities, including 29 variables previously
  suggested to influence perioperative outcomes. Although previous studies conducted
  in subgroups of spine surgery patients have suggested a deleterious effect for smoking
  on long-term outcomes in patients undergoing spine surgery, our analysis did not
  find smoking to be associated with early (30 d) perioperative morbidity or mortality.'
