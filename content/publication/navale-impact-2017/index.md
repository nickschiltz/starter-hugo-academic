abstract: 'BACKGROUND: As the prevalence of and life expectancy after solid organ
  transplantation increases, some of these patients will require total hip arthroplasty
  (THA). Immunosuppressive therapy, metabolic disorders, and post-transplant medications
  may place transplant patients at higher risk of adverse events following surgery.
  The objective of this study was to compare inpatient complications, mortality, length
  of stay (LOS), and costs for THA patients with and without solid organ transplant
  history. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional analysis was conducted using 1998-2011
  Nationwide Inpatient Sample. Primary THA patients were queried (n = 3,175,456).
  After exclusions, remaining patients were assigned to transplant (n = 7558) or non-transplant
  groups (n = 2,772,943). After propensity score matching, adjusted for patient and
  hospital characteristics, logistic regression and paired t-tests examined the effect
  of transplant history on outcomes. RESULTS: Between 1998 and 2011, THA volume among
  transplant patients grew approximately 48%. The overall prevalence of one or more
  complications following THA was greater in the transplant group than in the non-transplant
  group (32.0% vs 22.1%; P textless .001). In-hospital mortality was minimal, with
  comparable rates (0.1%) in both groups (P = .93). Unadjusted trends show that transplant
  patients have greater annual and overall mean LOS (4.47 days) and mean admission
  costs ($18,402) than non-transplant patients (3.73 days; $16,899; P textless .001).
  After propensity score matching, transplant history was associated with increased
  complication risk (odds ratio, 1.56) after THA, longer hospital LOS (+0.64 days;
  P textless .001), and increased admission costs (+$887; P = .005). CONCLUSION: Transplant
  patients exhibited increased odds of inpatient complications, longer LOS, and greater
  admission costs after THA compared with non-transplant patients.'
