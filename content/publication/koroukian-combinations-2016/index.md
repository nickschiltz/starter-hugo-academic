abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The strategic framework on multiple chronic conditions released
  by the US Department of Health and Human Services calls for identifying homogeneous
  subgroups of older adults to effectively target interventions aimed at improving
  their health. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify combinations of chronic conditions,
  functional limitations, and geriatric syndromes that predict poor health outcomes.
  DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS Data from the 2010-2012 Health and Retirement Study
  provided a representative sample of U.S. adults 50 years of age or older (n = 16,640).
  MAIN MEASURES: Outcomes were: Self-reported fair/poor health, self-rated worse health
  at 2 years, and 2-year mortality. The main independent variables included self-reported
  chronic conditions, functional limitations, and geriatric syndromes. We conducted
  tree-based classification and regression analysis to identify the most salient combinations
  of variables to predict outcomes. KEY RESULTS: Twenty-nine percent and 23 % of respondents
  reported fair/poor health and self-rated worse health at 2 years, respectively,
  and 5 % died in 2 years. The top combinations of conditions identified through our
  tree analysis for the three different outcome measures (and percent respondents
  with the outcome) were: a) for fair/poor health status: difficulty walking several
  blocks, depressive symptoms, and severe pain (textgreater 80 %); b) for self-rated
  worse health at 2 years: 68.5 years of age or older, difficulty walking several
  blocks and being in fair/poor health (60 %); and c) for 2-year mortality: 80.5 years
  of age or older, and presenting with limitations in both ADLs and IADLs (textgreater
  40 %). CONCLUSIONS: Rather than chronic conditions, functional limitations and/or
  geriatric syndromes were the most prominent conditions in predicting health outcomes.
  These findings imply that accounting for chronic conditions alone may be less informative
  than also accounting for the co-occurrence of functional limitations and geriatric
  syndromes, as the latter conditions appear to drive health outcomes in older individuals.'
