abstract: 'BACKGROUND: We sought to determine whether publication of blood conservation
  guidelines by the Society of Thoracic Surgeons in 2007 influenced transfusion rates
  and to understand how patient- and hospital-level factors influenced blood product
  usage. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We identified 4,465,016 patients in the Nationwide
  Inpatient Sample database who underwent cardiac operations between 1999 and 2010
  (3,202,404 before the guidelines and 1,262,612 after). Hierarchical linear modeling
  was used to account for hospital- and patient-level clustering. RESULTS: Transfusion
  rates of blood products increased from 13% in 1999 to a peak of 34% in 2010. Use
  of all blood components increased over the study period. Aortic aneurysm repair
  had the highest transfusion rate with 54% of patients receiving products in 2010.
  In coronary artery bypass grafting, the number of patients receiving blood products
  increased from 12% in 1999 to 32% in 2010. Patients undergoing valvular operations
  had a transfusion rate of 15% in 1999, increasing to 36% in 2010. Patients undergoing
  combined operations had an increase from 13% to 40% over 11 years. Risk factors
  for transfusion were anemia (odds ratio [OR], 2.05; 95% confidence interval [CI],
  2.01-2.09), coagulopathy (OR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.51-1.57), diabetes (OR, 1.32; 95%
  CI, 1.28-1.36), renal failure (OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.26-1.32), and liver disease (OR,
  1.23; 95% CI, 1.16-1.31). Compared to the Northeast, the risk for transfusion was
  significantly lower in the Midwest; higher-volume hospitals used fewer blood products
  than lower-volume centers. Cell salvage usage remained below 5% across all years.
  CONCLUSION: Independent of patient- and hospital-level factors, blood product utilization
  continues to increase for all cardiac operations despite publication of blood conservation
  guidelines in 2007.'
