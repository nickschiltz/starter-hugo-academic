abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Despite the ubiquitous use of total hip arthroplasty (THA)
  and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in older adults, little is known about the multimorbidity
  (MM) profile of this patient population. This study evaluates the temporal trends
  of MM, hypothesizing that patients with MM have had an increasingly greater representation
  in THA and TKA patients over time. METHODS: Data on a US representative sample of
  older adults from the linked Health and Retirement Study and Medicare data from
  1993 to 2012 were used. The Health and Retirement Study is a biennial survey that
  collects data on a broad array of measures, including self-reported chronic conditions
  and geriatric syndromes, which were used to account for MM. Medicare data were used
  to identify fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries who underwent THA (n = 479) or
  TKA (n = 998) during the study years, which were grouped into 3 periods: 1993-1999,
  2000-2006, and 2007-2012. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted
  to obtain age-, gender-, and race-adjusted time trends for MM. RESULTS: Compared
  to the earliest study period, and for both THA and TKA patients, there were significantly
  fewer patients with stroke and/or poor cognitive performance in the most recent
  study period. In addition, more TKA than THA patients presented with 2+ chronic
  conditions. Nearly 70% presented with co-occurring chronic conditions and geriatric
  syndromes, and this percentage did not change significantly over time. CONCLUSION:
  The high representation of THA and TKA patients presenting with co-occurring chronic
  conditions and geriatric syndromes in this patient population warrants detailed
  exploration of the effects of geriatric syndromes on postoperative outcomes.'
