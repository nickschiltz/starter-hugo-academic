abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Multimorbidity affects the majority of elderly adults and is
  associated with higher health costs and utilization, but how specific patterns of
  morbidity influence resource use is less understood. OBJECTIVE: The objective was
  to identify specific combinations of chronic conditions, functional limitations,
  and geriatric syndromes associated with direct medical costs and inpatient utilization.
  DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using the Health and Retirement Study (2008-2010)
  linked to Medicare claims. Analysis used machine-learning techniques: classification
  and regression trees and random forest. SUBJECTS: A population-based sample of 5771
  Medicare-enrolled adults aged 65 and older in the United States. MEASURES: Main
  covariates: self-reported chronic conditions (measured as none, mild, or severe),
  geriatric syndromes, and functional limitations. Secondary covariates: demographic,
  social, economic, behavioral, and health status measures. OUTCOMES: Medicare expenditures
  in the top quartile and inpatient utilization. RESULTS: Median annual expenditures
  were $4354, and 41% were hospitalized within 2 years. The tree model shows some
  notable combinations: 64% of those with self-rated poor health plus activities of
  daily living and instrumental activities of daily living disabilities had expenditures
  in the top quartile. Inpatient utilization was highest (70%) in those aged 77-83
  with mild to severe heart disease plus mild to severe diabetes. Functional limitations
  were more important than many chronic diseases in explaining resource use. CONCLUSIONS:
  The multimorbid population is heterogeneous and there is considerable variation
  in how specific combinations of morbidity influence resource use. Modeling the conjoint
  effects of chronic conditions, functional limitations, and geriatric syndromes can
  advance understanding of groups at greatest risk and inform targeted tailored interventions
  aimed at cost containment.'
