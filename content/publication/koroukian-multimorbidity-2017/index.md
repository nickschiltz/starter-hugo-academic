abstract: "INTRODUCTION: The Department of Health and Human Services' 2010 Strategic\
  \ Framework on Multiple Chronic Conditions called for the identification of common\
  \ constellations of conditions in older adults. OBJECTIVES: To analyze patterns\
  \ of conditions constituting multimorbidity (CCMM) and expenditures in a US representative\
  \ sample of midlife and older adults (50-64 and ≥65 years of age, respectively).\
  \ DESIGN: A cross-sectional study of the 2010 Health and Retirement Study (HRS;\
  \ n=17,912). The following measures were used: (1) count and combinations of CCMM,\
  \ including (i) chronic conditions (hypertension, arthritis, heart disease, lung\
  \ disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer, and psychiatric conditions), (ii) functional\
  \ limitations (upper body limitations, lower body limitations, strength limitations,\
  \ limitations in activities of daily living, and limitations in instrumental activities\
  \ of daily living), and (iii) geriatric syndromes (cognitive impairment, depressive\
  \ symptoms, incontinence, visual impairment, hearing impairment, severe pain, and\
  \ dizziness); and (2) annualized 2011 Medicare expenditures for HRS participants\
  \ who were Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries (n=5,677). Medicaid beneficiaries\
  \ were also identified based on their self-reported insurance status. RESULTS: No\
  \ large representations of participants within specific CCMM categories were observed;\
  \ however, functional limitations and geriatric syndromes were prominently present\
  \ with higher CCMM counts. Among fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries aged 50-64\
  \ years, 26.7% of the participants presented with ≥10 CCMM, but incurred 48% of\
  \ the expenditure. In those aged ≥65 years, these percentages were 16.9% and 34.4%,\
  \ respectively. CONCLUSION: Functional limitations and geriatric syndromes considerably\
  \ add to the MM burden in midlife and older adults. This burden is much higher than\
  \ previously reported."
