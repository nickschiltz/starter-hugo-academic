abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Underlying psychiatric conditions may affect outcomes of surgical
  treatment for colorectal cancer (CRC) because of complex clinical presentation and
  treatment considerations. We hypothesized that patients with psychiatric illness
  (PSYCH) would have evidence of advanced disease at presentation, as manifested by
  higher rates of colorectal surgery performed in the presence of obstruction, perforation,
  and/or peritonitis (OPP-surgery). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using data from the 2007-2011
  National Inpatient Sample, we identified patients with a diagnosis of CRC undergoing
  colorectal surgery. In addition to somatic comorbid conditions flagged in the National
  Inpatient Sample, we used the Clinical Classification Software to identify patients
  with PSYCH, including schizophrenia, delirium/dementia, developmental disorders,
  alcohol/substance abuse, and other psychiatric conditions. Our study outcome was
  OPP-surgery. In addition to descriptive analysis, we conducted multivariable logistic
  regression analysis to analyze the independent association between each of the PSYCH
  conditions and OPP-surgery, after adjusting for patient demographics and somatic
  comorbidities. RESULTS: Our study population included 591,561 patients with CRC
  and undergoing colorectal cancer surgery, of whom 60.6% were aged 65 years or older,
  49.4% were women, and 6.3% had five or more comorbid conditions. Then, 17.9% presented
  with PSYCH. The percent of patients undergoing OPP-surgery was 13.9% in the study
  population but was significantly higher for patients with schizophrenia (19.3%),
  delirium and dementia (18.5%), developmental disorders (19.7%), and alcohol/substance
  abuse (19.5%). In multivariable analysis, schizophrenia, delirium/dementia, and
  alcohol/substance abuse were each independently associated with increased rates
  of OPP-surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PSYCH may have obstacles in receiving
  optimal care for CRC. Those with PSYCH diagnoses had significantly higher rates
  of OPP-surgery. Additional evaluation is required to further characterize the clinical
  implications of advanced disease presentation for patients with PSYCH diagnoses
  and colorectal cancer.'
