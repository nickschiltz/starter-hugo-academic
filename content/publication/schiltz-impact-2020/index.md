abstract: "BACKGROUND: Limitations in instrumental activities of daily living (IADL)\
  \ hinder a person's ability to live independently in the community and self-manage\
  \ their conditions, but its impact on hospital readmission has not been firmly established.\
  \ OBJECTIVE: To test the importance of IADL dependency as a predictor of 30-day\
  \ readmissions and quantify its impact relative to other morbidities. DESIGN: A\
  \ retrospective cohort study of the population-based Health and Retirement Study\
  \ linked to Medicare claims data. Random forest was used to rank each predictor\
  \ variable in terms of its ability to predict readmission. Classification and regression\
  \ tree (CART) was used to identify complex multimorbidity combinations associated\
  \ with high or low risk of readmission. Generalized linear regression was used to\
  \ estimate the adjusted relative risk of readmission for IADL limitations. SUBJECTS:\
  \ Hospitalizations of adults age 65 and older (n = 20,007), from 6617 unique subjects.\
  \ MAIN MEASURES: The main outcome was 30-day all-cause unplanned readmission. The\
  \ main predictor of interest was self-reported IADL limitation. Other key predictors\
  \ were self-reported complex multimorbidity including chronic diseases, geriatric\
  \ syndromes, and activities of daily living (ADL) limitations, along with demographic,\
  \ socioeconomic, and behavioral factors. KEY RESULTS: The overall 30-day readmission\
  \ rate in the study was 16.4%. Random forest analysis ranked ADLs and IADL limitations\
  \ as the two most important predictors of 30-day readmission. CART identified hospitalizations\
  \ of patients with IADL limitations and diabetes as a subgroup at the highest risk\
  \ of readmission (26% readmitted). Multivariable regression analyses showed that\
  \ ADL limitations were associated with 1.17 (1.06-1.29) times higher risk of readmission\
  \ even after adjusting for other patient covariates. Risk prediction was modest\
  \ though for even the best model (AUC = 0.612). CONCLUSIONS: IADL limitations are\
  \ key predictors of 30-day readmission as demonstrated using several machine learning\
  \ methods. Routine assessment of functional abilities in hospital settings could\
  \ help identify those most at risk."
