abstract: "Objective: To demonstrate the usefulness of applying supervised machine-learning\
  \ analyses to identify specific groups of patients that experience high levels of\
  \ mortality post-interhospital transfer. Methods: This was a cross-sectional analysis\
  \ of data from the Health Care Utilization Project 2013 National Inpatient Sample,\
  \ that applied supervised machine-learning approaches that included (1) classification\
  \ and regression tree to identify mutually exclusive groups of patients and their\
  \ associated characteristics of those experiencing the highest levels of mortality\
  \ and (2) random forest to identify the relative importance of each characteristic's\
  \ contribution to post-transfer mortality. Results: A total of 21 independent groups\
  \ of patients were identified, with 13 of those groups exhibiting at least double\
  \ the national average rate of mortality post-transfer. Patient characteristics\
  \ identified as influencing post-transfer mortality the most included: diagnosis\
  \ of a circulatory disorder, comorbidity of coagulopathy, diagnosis of cancer, and\
  \ age. Conclusions: Employing supervised machine-learning analyses enabled the computational\
  \ feasibility to assess all potential combinations of available patient characteristics\
  \ to identify groups of patients experiencing the highest rates of mortality post-interhospital\
  \ transfer, providing potentially useful data to support developing clinical decision\
  \ support systems in future work."
