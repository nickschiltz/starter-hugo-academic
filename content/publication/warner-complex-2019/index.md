abstract: "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: There is minimal survival benefit to cancer\
  \ screening for those with poor clinical presentation (complex multimorbidity) or\
  \ at advanced ages. The current screening mammography guidelines consider these\
  \ objective indicators. There has been less attention, however, to women's subjective\
  \ assessment of screening need. This study examines the interplay between complex\
  \ multimorbidity, age, and subjective assessments of health and longevity for screening\
  \ mammography receipt. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHOD: This cross-sectional study uses\
  \ self-reported data from 8,938 women over the age of 52 in the 2012 Health and\
  \ Retirement Study. Logistic regression models estimated the association between\
  \ women's complex multimorbidity (co-occurrence of chronic conditions, functional\
  \ limitations, and/or geriatric syndromes), subjective health and longevity assessments,\
  \ age, and screening mammography in the 2 years before the interview. These associations\
  \ were evaluated adjusting for sociodemographic and behavioral factors. RESULTS:\
  \ Both age and complex multimorbidity were negatively associated with screening\
  \ mammography. However, women's perceived need for screening moderated these effects.\
  \ Most significantly, women optimistic about their chances of living another 10-15\
  \ years were more likely to have had screening mammography regardless of their health\
  \ conditions or advanced age. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Women with more favorable\
  \ self-assessed health and perceived life expectancy were more likely to receive\
  \ screening mammography even if they have poor clinical presentation or advanced\
  \ age. This is contrary to current cancer screening guidelines and suggests an opportunity\
  \ to engage women's subjective health and longevity assessments for cancer screening\
  \ decision making in both for screening policy and in individual clinician recommendations."
