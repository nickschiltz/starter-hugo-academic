abstract: The aim of this descriptive study was to establish and describe the national
  incidence, cost, and outcomes of patients that undergo medical transfer. Using discharge
  data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample 2011, Healthcare Cost and Utilization
  Project, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the dataset was analyzed using
  weighted frequency distribution. Approximately 1.6 million patients are transferred
  yearly. Transferred patients experience a mean length of stay of 9.3 days (std dv
  13.5) versus 4.3 days for patients not transferred (std dv 6.0), and cost more than
  twice as much (mean $19,234) versus those not transferred (mean $9,469). Additionally,
  patients who undergo inter-facility transfer cost an additional $15.8 billion annually.
  Interhospital patient transfers require closer scrutiny regarding appropriateness
  and future policy implications.
