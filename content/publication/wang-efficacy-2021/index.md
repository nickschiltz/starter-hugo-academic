abstract: The role of filgrastim during acute myeloid leukemia (AML) induction therapy
  remains controversial. At our institution, newly diagnosed AML patients from 2003
  through 2019 were retrospectively evaluated. Patients were stratified on whether
  they received filgrastim within 5 days after early assessment bone marrow (BMBx)
  and divided into early GCSF group (eGCSF) and no-eGCSF group. A total of 121 patients
  were included. We found significantly shorter hospital stay (median 24 vs 26 days,
  p textless .01), absolute neutrophil count recovery days (median 23 vs 25 days,
  p = .03), and intravenous antibiotics days (mean 18.5 vs 21.4 days, p = .01) in
  patients with eGCSF comparing with no-eGCSF. There was no significant difference
  regarding complete response rates; however, for those failed to achieve remission,
  eGCSF was associated with higher blast count. There was no significant difference
  regarding overall survival or progression-free survival. The use of eGCSF was associated
  with cost savings of $5199 per patient over no-eGCSF.
