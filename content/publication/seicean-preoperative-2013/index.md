abstract: 'STUDY DESIGN: Analysis of the prospectively collected American College
  of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. OBJECTIVE: To
  assess whether preoperative anemia predicted adverse, early, perioperative outcomes
  in patients undergoing elective spine surgery. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Prior
  studies have assessed the association of anemia with outcomes in various noncardiac
  surgical procedures. The association between preoperative anemia and 30-day outcomes
  for spine surgery is unknown. METHODS: A total of 24,473 adults, classified as having
  severe (N = 88), moderate (N = 314), mild (N = 5477), and no anemia. Using propensity
  scores, patients with severe, mild, and moderate anemia were matched with patients
  with no anemia. Logistic regression was used to predict adverse postoperative outcomes.
  Sensitivity analyses were conducted limiting the study sample to patients who did
  not receive intra- or postoperative transfusion and to patients with and without
  preoperative cardiovascular comorbidities. RESULTS: Patients with all levels of
  anemia had significantly higher risk of nearly all adverse outcomes than nonanemic
  patients in unadjusted and propensity-matched models. Patients with moderate and
  mild anemia were more likely to have prolonged length of hospitalization, experience
  1 or more complications, and expire within 30 days of surgery compared with nonanemic
  patients. The association between anemia and adverse outcomes was found independently
  of intra- and postoperative transfusions, and was not more pronounced in patients
  with preoperative cardiovascular comorbidities. CONCLUSION: All levels of anemia
  were significantly associated with prolonged length of hospitalization and poorer
  operative or 30-day outcomes in patients undergoing elective spine surgery. Our
  findings, using a large multi-institutional sample of prospectively collected data,
  suggests that anemia should be regarded as an independent risk factor for perioperative
  and postoperative complications that deserves attention prior to elective spine
  surgery.'
