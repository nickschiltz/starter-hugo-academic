 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cirrhosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality and is an important risk factor for complications in surgical patients. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association of cirrhosis with postoperative complications, length of stay (LOS), and costs among patients who underwent total knee arthroplasty (TKA) or total hip arthroplasty (THA).
METHODS: Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample between 2000 and 2011, we identified patients who had a primary TKA or primary THA. TKA patients were divided into 2 groups: (1) cirrhosis (n = 41,464) and (2) no cirrhosis (n = 5,721,297) and THA patients were divided into 2 groups: (1) cirrhosis (n = 27,401) and (2) no cirrhosis (n = 2,622,539). Patient demographics, comorbidities, perioperative complications, LOS, and incremental costs were analyzed. An additional subgroup analysis by cirrhosis etiology was performed.
RESULTS: Multivariable analysis revealed cirrhosis was associated with 1.55 (95% confidence interval: 1.47-1.63) times higher odds of any complication after TKA and 1.59 (1.50-1.69) higher odds after THA. Adjusted outcomes showed cirrhotic TKA patients had \$1857 higher costs and 0.30 days longer LOS and THA cirrhotic patients had \$1497 higher costs and 0.48 longer LOS. We found similar results for each cirrhosis subtype but alcohol-related had the highest resource use and complication rate.
CONCLUSION: Patients with cirrhosis who are undergoing TKA or THA are at a significantly increased risk for perioperative complications, increased LOS, and higher costs. The perioperative complications and costs were highest among patients with alcohol-related cirrhosis.},
