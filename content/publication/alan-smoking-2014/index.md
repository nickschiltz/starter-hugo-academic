abstract: "OBJECT: The goal in this study was to assess whether a current or prior\
  \ history of smoking and the number of smoking pack years affect the risk for adverse\
  \ outcomes in the 30-day postoperative period in patients who undergo elective cranial\
  \ surgery. METHODS: Data from the 2006-2011 American College of Surgeons' National\
  \ Surgical Quality Improvement Project were used in this study. The authors identified\
  \ 8296 patients who underwent elective cranial surgery, of whom 1718 were current\
  \ smokers, 854 were prior smokers, and 5724 were never smokers. Using propensity\
  \ scores and age, the authors matched current and prior smokers to never smokers.\
  \ Odds ratios for adverse postoperative outcomes were predicted with logistic regression.\
  \ The relationship between number of pack years and poor outcomes was also examined.\
  \ RESULTS: In unadjusted analyses, prior and current smokers did not differ from\
  \ never smokers for having poor outcomes postoperatively. Similarly, in matched\
  \ analyses, no association was found between smoking and adverse outcomes. Number\
  \ of pack years in propensity-matched analyses did not predict worse outcomes in\
  \ prior or current smokers versus never smokers. CONCLUSIONS: The authors did not\
  \ find smoking to be associated with 30-day postoperative morbidity or mortality.\
  \ Although smoking cessation is beneficial for overall health, it may not improve\
  \ the short-term (â‰¤ 30 days) outcome of elective cranial surgery. Thus postponement\
  \ of elective cranial cases only for smoking cessation may not be necessary."
