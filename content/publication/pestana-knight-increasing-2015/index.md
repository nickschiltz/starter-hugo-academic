abstract: "OBJECTIVE: To examine national trends of pediatric epilepsy surgery usage\
  \ in the United States between 1997 and 2009. METHODS: We performed a serial cross-sectional\
  \ study of pediatric epilepsy surgery using triennial data from the Kids' Inpatient\
  \ Database from 1997 to 2009. The rates of epilepsy surgery for lobectomies, partial\
  \ lobectomies, and hemispherectomies in each study year were calculated based on\
  \ the number of prevalent epilepsy cases in the corresponding year. The age-race-sex\
  \ adjusted rates of surgeries were also estimated. Mann-Kendall trend test was used\
  \ to test for changes in the rates of surgeries over time. Multivariable regression\
  \ analysis was also performed to estimate the effect of time, age, race, and sex\
  \ on the annual incidence of epilepsy surgery. RESULTS: The rates of pediatric epilepsy\
  \ surgery increased significantly from 0.85 epilepsy surgeries per 1,000 children\
  \ with epilepsy in 1997 to 1.44 epilepsy surgeries per 1,000 children with epilepsy\
  \ in 2009. An increment in the rates of epilepsy surgeries was noted across all\
  \ age groups, in boys and girls, all races, and all payer types. The rate of increase\
  \ was lowest in blacks and in children with public insurance. The overall number\
  \ of surgical cases for each study year was lower than 35% of children who were\
  \ expected to have surgery, based on the estimates from the Connecticut Study of\
  \ Epilepsy. SIGNIFICANCE: In contrast to adults, pediatric epilepsy surgery numbers\
  \ have increased significantly in the past decade. However, epilepsy surgery remains\
  \ an underutilized treatment for children with epilepsy. In addition, black children\
  \ and those with public insurance continue to face disparities in the receipt of\
  \ epilepsy surgery."
