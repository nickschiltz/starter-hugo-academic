abstract: \"Off-label use\" refers to medical device utilization for purposes or subpopulations
  other than those approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration. The
  primary goal of this study was to determine the current epidemiology of off-label
  total hip and knee arthroplasties (THA and TKA, respectively) in the United States
  and to project further off-label use through 2040. Over the past decade, the prevalence
  of off-label THA and TKA was 30.4% and 37.0%, respectively, growing ~70% from 2000
  to 2010. By 2040, the majority of THAs (86.1%) and TKAs (91.5%) could be off-label.
  The high prevalence of off-label arthroplasty and the dramatically shifting patient
  profile illustrated by these results highlight the need for continued medical device
  surveillance among on- and off label patients.
