abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Functional status plays an important role in the comprehensive
  characterization of older adults. Functional limitations are associated with an
  increased risk of adverse treatment outcomes, but there are limited data on the
  prevalence of functional limitations in older women with pelvic floor disorders.
  OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to describe the prevalence of functional limitations
  based on health status in older women with pelvic organ prolapse (POP). STUDY DESIGN:
  This pooled, cross-sectional study utilized data from the linked Health and Retirement
  Study and Medicare files from 1992 through 2008. The analysis included 890 women
  age â‰¥65 years with POP. We assessed self-reported functional status, categorized
  in strength, upper and lower body mobility, activities of daily living (ADL), and
  instrumental ADL (IADL) domains. Functional limitations were evaluated and stratified
  by respondents self-reported general health status. Descriptive statistics were
  used to compare categorical and continuous variables, and logistic regression was
  used to measure differences in the odds of functional limitation by increasing age.
  RESULTS: The prevalence of functional limitations was 76.2% in strength, 44.9% in
  upper and 65.8% in lower body mobility, 4.5% in ADL, and 13.6% in IADL. Limitations
  were more prevalent in women with poor or fair health status than in women with
  good health status, including 91.5% vs 69.9% in strength, 72.9% vs 33.5% in upper
  and 88.0% vs 56.8% in lower body mobility, 11.6% vs 0.9% in ADL, and 30.6% vs 6.7%
  in IADL; all P textless .01. The odds of all functional limitations also increased
  significantly with advancing age. CONCLUSION: Functional limitations, especially
  in strength and body mobility domains, are highly prevalent in older women with
  POP, particularly in those with poor or fair self-reported health status. Future
  research is necessary to evaluate if functional status affects clinical outcomes
  in pelvic reconstructive and gynecologic surgery and whether it should be routinely
  assessed in clinical decision-making when treating older women with POP.'
