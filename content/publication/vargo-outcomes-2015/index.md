abstract: A growing number of solid organ transplant survivors require surgery for
  cardiac disease. We examined the effect of having a previous transplant on outcomes
  after cardiac surgery in these patients from a population-based perspective. Of
  1,709,735 patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting, valve, or thoracic
  aorta surgery from 2004 to 2008 in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, 3,535 patients
  (0.21%) had a previous organ transplant (2,712 kidney, 738 liver, 300 pancreas).
  Multivariate logistic regression analysis and propensity score matching were used
  to determine the effect of a previous solid organ transplant on outcomes. In-hospital
  mortality rate was 7% for patients who underwent transplantation versus 4% for patients
  who did not undergo transplantation (odds ratio [OR] 1.66, 95% confidence interval
  [CI] 1.16 to 2.38). Patients who underwent transplantation were at an increased
  risk for acute renal failure (OR 1.62, CI 1.36 to 1.94) and blood transfusions (OR
  1.63, CI 1.36 to 1.95). Median length of stay was longer (10 vs 9 days), with greater
  median total charges ($111,362 vs $102,221; both p textless0.001). Occurrence of
  stroke, gastrointestinal complication, infection, and pneumonia was similar between
  groups. In conclusion, previous solid organ transplantation is an incremental risk
  factor for postoperative mortality after cardiac surgery. Renal protective strategies
  and bleeding control should be stressed to mitigate complications.
