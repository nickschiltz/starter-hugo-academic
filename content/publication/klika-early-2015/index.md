abstract: 'This review of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (1998-2011) examined trends
  in solid organ transplant patients who received a total knee arthroplasty (TKA)
  to determine whether length of stay (LOS), cost, and perioperative complications
  differed from non-transplant peers. Primary TKA patients (n=5,870,421) were categorized
  as: (1) those with a history of solid organ transplant (n=6104) and (2) those without
  (n=5,864,317). Propensity matching was used to estimate adjusted effects of solid
  organ transplant history on perioperative outcomes. The percentage of TKA patients
  with a transplant history grew during the study period from 0.069% to 0.103%. Adjusted
  outcomes showed patients with a transplant had a 0.44 day longer LOS, $962 higher
  cost of admission, and were 1.43 times more likely to suffer any complication (P=0.0002).'
