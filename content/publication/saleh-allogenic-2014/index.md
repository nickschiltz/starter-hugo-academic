abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The large-scale utilization of allogenic blood transfusion
  and its associated outcomes have been described in critically ill patients and those
  undergoing high-risk cardiac surgery but not in patients undergoing elective total
  hip arthroplasty. The objective of this study was to determine the trends in utilization
  and outcomes of allogenic blood transfusion in patients undergoing primary total
  hip arthroplasty in the United States from 2000 to 2009. METHODS: An observational
  cohort of 2,087,423 patients who underwent primary total hip arthroplasty from 2000
  to 2009 was identified in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample. International Classification
  of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification procedure codes 99.03 and 99.04
  were used to identify patients who received allogenic blood products during their
  hospital stay. Risk factors for allogenic transfusions were identified with use
  of multivariable logistic regression models. We used propensity score matching to
  estimate the adjusted association between transfusion and surgical outcomes. RESULTS:
  The rate of allogenic blood transfusion increased from 11.8% in 2000 to 19.0% in
  2009. Patient-related risk factors for receiving an allogenic blood transfusion
  include an older age, female sex, black race, and Medicaid insurance. Hospital-related
  risk factors include rural location, smaller size, and non-academic status. After
  adjusting for confounders, allogenic blood transfusion was associated with a longer
  hospital stay (0.58 ± 0.02 day; p textless 0.001), increased costs ($1731 ± $49
  [in 2009 U.S. dollars]; p textless 0.001), increased rate of discharge to an inpatient
  facility (odds ratio, 1.28; 95% confidence interval, 1.26 to 1.31), and worse surgical
  and medical outcomes. In-hospital mortality was not affected by allogenic blood
  transfusion (odds ratio, 0.97; 95% confidence interval, 0.77 to 1.21). CONCLUSIONS:
  The increase in allogenic blood transfusion among total hip arthroplasty patients
  is concerning considering the associated increase in surgical complications and
  adverse events. The risk factors for transfusion and its impact on costs and inpatient
  outcomes can potentially be used to enhance patient care through optimizing preoperative
  discussions and effective utilization of blood-conservation methods.'
