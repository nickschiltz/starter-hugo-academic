 abstract = {BACKGROUND: The objective of this study is to identify risk factors associated with readmission after gastrectomy to potentially identify potential areas for targeted improvements. Hospital readmission after surgery is a topic of interest in health-care policy among hospitals, payers, and providers. Readmissions are associated with increased costs, morbidity, and mortality. Readmission rates have been proposed as a quality metric for hospitals and quality indicator of individual surgeon's performance. In addition, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has reduced payments to hospitals with excessive readmissions for certain diagnoses.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All gastrectomy procedures for malignancy in patients aged ≥18 y from 2005 to 2011 were queried from the California State Inpatient Database. Patients who died during index admission were excluded. Descriptive statistics were examined between all baseline variables and readmission status. Logistic regression models were adjusted for age, race, sex, and insurance status.
RESULTS: A total of 6985 patients underwent gastrectomy for malignancy; 16.5% of the patients were readmitted after postoperative discharge. Readmission rate did not change significantly over time. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that the occurrence of any postoperative complications, postoperative length of stay greater than 10 d, discharge to skilled nursing facility or home health care, combined resection with distal pancreatectomy and/or splenectomy, and patient comorbidities like diabetes mellitus and renal failure were independently associated with readmissions.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that focusing on quality improvement efforts by targeting reduction of postoperative complications may reduce readmission rates.},
