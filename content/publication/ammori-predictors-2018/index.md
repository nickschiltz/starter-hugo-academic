abstract: "BACKGROUND: The objective of this study is to identify risk factors associated\
  \ with readmission after gastrectomy to potentially identify potential areas for\
  \ targeted improvements. Hospital readmission after surgery is a topic of interest\
  \ in health-care policy among hospitals, payers, and providers. Readmissions are\
  \ associated with increased costs, morbidity, and mortality. Readmission rates have\
  \ been proposed as a quality metric for hospitals and quality indicator of individual\
  \ surgeon's performance. In addition, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services\
  \ has reduced payments to hospitals with excessive readmissions for certain diagnoses.\
  \ MATERIALS AND METHODS: All gastrectomy procedures for malignancy in patients aged\
  \ ≥18 y from 2005 to 2011 were queried from the California State Inpatient Database.\
  \ Patients who died during index admission were excluded. Descriptive statistics\
  \ were examined between all baseline variables and readmission status. Logistic\
  \ regression models were adjusted for age, race, sex, and insurance status. RESULTS:\
  \ A total of 6985 patients underwent gastrectomy for malignancy; 16.5% of the patients\
  \ were readmitted after postoperative discharge. Readmission rate did not change\
  \ significantly over time. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that the occurrence\
  \ of any postoperative complications, postoperative length of stay greater than\
  \ 10 d, discharge to skilled nursing facility or home health care, combined resection\
  \ with distal pancreatectomy and/or splenectomy, and patient comorbidities like\
  \ diabetes mellitus and renal failure were independently associated with readmissions.\
  \ CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that focusing on quality improvement efforts\
  \ by targeting reduction of postoperative complications may reduce readmission rates."
