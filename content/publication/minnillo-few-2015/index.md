abstract: "INTRODUCTION: We sought to determine the patient and provider-related factors\
  \ associated with readmission after radical cystectomy (RC) for bladder cancer.\
  \ In this era of healthcare reform, hospital performance measures, such as readmission,\
  \ are beginning to affect provider reimbursement. Given its high readmission rate,\
  \ RC could be a target for quality improvement. METHODS: We reviewed bladder cancer\
  \ patients who underwent RC in California's State Inpatient Database (2005-2009)\
  \ of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project. We examined patient-(e.g., race,\
  \ discharge disposition) and provider-related factors (e.g., volume) and evaluated\
  \ their association with 30-day readmission. Multivariable logistic regression was\
  \ used to examine associations of interest. RESULTS: Overall, 22.8% (n = 833) of\
  \ the 3649 patients who underwent RC were readmitted within 30 days. Regarding disposition,\
  \ 34.8%, 50.8%, and 12.2% were discharged home, home with home healthcare, and to\
  \ a post-acute care facility (PACF), respectively. Within 30 days, 20.3%, 20.9%,\
  \ and 42.3% were discharged home, home with home healthcare, and to a PACF were\
  \ readmitted, respectively. African Americans (odds ratio [OR] 1.64, 95% confidence\
  \ interval [CI] 1.07-2.50), having ≥2 comorbidities (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.06-1.91),\
  \ receiving a neobladder (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.09-1.93), and discharged to a PACF (OR\
  \ 3.79, 95% CI 2.88-4.98) were independent factors associated with readmission.\
  \ Hospital stays ≥15 days were associated with less readmission (OR 0.43, 95% CI\
  \ 0.27-0.67, p = 0.0002). Procedure volume was not associated with complication,\
  \ in-hospital mortality, or readmission. CONCLUSIONS: About one-fifth of patients\
  \ undergoing RC are readmitted. Patients who are discharged to a PACF, African American,\
  \ and who have more extensive comorbidities tend to experience more readmissions.\
  \ Increased efforts with care coordination among these patients may help reduce\
  \ readmissions."
