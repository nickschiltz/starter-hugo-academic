abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Passive case finding (PCF) is the strategy implemented by most
  developing countries to detect new cases of tuberculosis (TB), but detection rates
  remain low. Active case finding (ACF) is an alternative strategy, although cost
  is a barrier to implementation. We estimated the cost-effectiveness of a city-wide
  ACF programme in Kampala, Uganda, compared to the PCF strategy. METHODS: We developed
  a decision tree and Markov model to compare ACF vs. PCF across several outcome measures.
  Parameter estimates for costs, probabilities and utility scores were obtained from
  published reports and peer-reviewed journal articles. The main outcome measures
  were TB cases detected, deaths averted, life years saved (LYS) and quality-adjusted
  life years (QALYs). RESULTS: Our model found that ACF implemented city-wide would
  result in an additional 1594 TB cases detected in 1 year, 675 deaths averted over
  a 5-year period, 21,928 LYS, and would cost an additional US$109 per additional
  QALY. The 25-34 year age group received most health benefits (556 cases detected,
  229 deaths averted, 8058 LYS), and the programme was most cost-effective in the
  45-54 year age group (US$51/QALY). CONCLUSIONS: ACF is an effective strategy for
  TB control and improving quality of life and is also cost-effective.'
