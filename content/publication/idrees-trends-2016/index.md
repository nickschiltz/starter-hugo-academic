abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Postoperative stroke is a devastating complication after aortic
  valve replacement (AVR). Our objective was to use a large national database to identify
  the incidence of and risk factors for stroke after AVR, as well as to determine
  incremental mortality, resource use, and cost of stroke. METHODS: We identified
  360,437 patients who underwent isolated surgical AVR between 1998 and 2011 from
  the National Inpatient Sample (NIH) database. Mean age was 66 Â± 32 years. Multivariable
  regression and propensity matching were used to identify risk factors and the effect
  of stroke on outcomes. Patients were stratified according to the Elixhauser comorbidity
  score (ECS) into low- (0-5), medium- (6-15), and high-risk (16+) categories. RESULTS:
  Stroke after AVR occurred in 5,092 (1.45%) patients. The incidence of stroke declined
  from 1.69% in 1999 to 0.94% in 2011 (p textless 0.001). Increasing age and higher
  comorbidities were the main predictors of stroke (each p textless 0.001). The highest-volume
  centers (textgreater200 AVRs/y) had the lowest rate of stroke (1.2%). After multivariable
  adjustment, high-volume centers had lower odds of stroke in medium-risk (odds ratio
  [OR], 0.59; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37-0.94) and high-risk patients (OR,
  0.39; 95% CI, 0.22-0.68) compared with the lowest-volume centers. For low-risk patients,
  volume was not associated with stroke. Patients who experienced stroke were hospitalized
  for 4 days longer, had an average of $10,496 higher costs, and had 2.74 (95% CI,
  1.97-3.80) times higher odds of in-hospital mortality compared with those who did
  not experience stroke (all p textless 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of stroke
  after AVR has decreased but remains a significant cause of morbidity in medium-
  and high-risk patients. Superior outcomes can be achieved in medium- to high-risk
  patients at high-volume centers.'
