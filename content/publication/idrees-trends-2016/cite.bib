 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative stroke is a devastating complication after aortic valve replacement (AVR). Our objective was to use a large national database to identify the incidence of and risk factors for stroke after AVR, as well as to determine incremental mortality, resource use, and cost of stroke.
METHODS: We identified 360,437 patients who underwent isolated surgical AVR between 1998 and 2011 from the National Inpatient Sample (NIH) database. Mean age was 66 Â± 32 years. Multivariable regression and propensity matching were used to identify risk factors and the effect of stroke on outcomes. Patients were stratified according to the Elixhauser comorbidity score (ECS) into low- (0-5), medium- (6-15), and high-risk (16+) categories.
RESULTS: Stroke after AVR occurred in 5,092 (1.45%) patients. The incidence of stroke declined from 1.69% in 1999 to 0.94% in 2011 (p \textless 0.001). Increasing age and higher comorbidities were the main predictors of stroke (each p \textless 0.001). The highest-volume centers (\textgreater200 AVRs/y) had the lowest rate of stroke (1.2%). After multivariable adjustment, high-volume centers had lower odds of stroke in medium-risk (odds ratio [OR], 0.59; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37-0.94) and high-risk patients (OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.22-0.68) compared with the lowest-volume centers. For low-risk patients, volume was not associated with stroke. Patients who experienced stroke were hospitalized for 4 days longer, had an average of \$10,496 higher costs, and had 2.74 (95% CI, 1.97-3.80) times higher odds of in-hospital mortality compared with those who did not experience stroke (all p \textless 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of stroke after AVR has decreased but remains a significant cause of morbidity in medium- and high-risk patients. Superior outcomes can be achieved in medium- to high-risk patients at high-volume centers.},
