abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Studies have suggested that the success of 2-stage revision
  total knee arthroplasty (rTKA) may be compromised by a prior failed irrigation and
  debridement (I&D). The purpose of this study was to use 2 large state inpatient
  databases to compare the 2-stage rTKA failure rates for those patients with and
  without a prior I&D. METHODS: This retrospective, longitudinal study used inpatient
  discharge data from the State Inpatient Database of 2 states (California and New
  York) from 2005 to 2011. A combination of International Classification of Diseases,
  Ninth Revision, diagnosis and procedure codes was used to identify rTKA patients
  and compare failure rates for rTKA patients with and without prior I&D. The primary
  outcome was failure of the staged revision, which was defined as subsequent surgery
  due to infection within 4 years of the 2-stage rTKA. RESULTS: Of the 750 patients
  who underwent 2-stage rTKA, 57 had undergone a prior I&D. In all, 126 patients failed
  rTKA. After 4 years, the estimated failure rate was 8.7% (95% confidence interval
  [CI], 1.9%-16.9%) in the group with prior I&D and 17.5% (95% CI, 14.7%-20.4%) in
  the group without prior I&D. After adjusting for sex, race, insurance, median household
  income, and comorbidities, the hazard ratio for the group with a failed I&D was
  0.49 (P = .122; 95% CI, 0.20-1.20), which indicated a lower risk of failure compared
  to the group without prior I&D. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that the failure
  rate of 2-stage rTKA is not increased by prior failed I&D.'
