abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The HospitAl length of stay, Readmissions and Mortality (HARM)
  score is a simple, inexpensive quality tool, linked directly to patient outcomes.
  We assess the HARM score for measuring surgical quality across multiple surgical
  populations. METHODS: Upper gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary, and colorectal surgery
  cases between 2005 and 2009 were identified from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization
  Project California State Inpatient Database. Composite and individual HARM scores
  were calculated from length of stay, 30-day readmission and mortality, correlated
  to complication rates for each hospital and stratified by operative type. RESULTS:
  71,419 admissions were analyzed. Higher HARM scores correlated with higher complication
  rates for all cases after risk adjustment and stratification by operation type,
  elective or emergent status. CONCLUSIONS: The HARM score is a simple and valid quality
  measurement for upper gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary and colorectal surgery. The
  HARM score could facilitate benchmarking to improve patient outcomes and resource
  utilization, and may facilitate outcome improvement.'
