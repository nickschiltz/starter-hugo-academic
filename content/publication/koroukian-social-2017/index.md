abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: Most prior studies on aggressive end-of-life care in older patients
  with cancer have accounted for social determinants of health (e.g., race, income,
  and education), but rarely for multimoribidity (MM). In this study, we examine the
  association between end-of-life care and each of the social determinants of health
  and MM, hypothesizing that higher MM is associated with less aggressive care. METHODS:
  From the linked 1991-2008 Health and Retirement Study, Medicare data, and the National
  Death Index, we identified fee-for-service patients age â‰¥66years who died from cancer
  (n=835). MM was defined as the occurrence or co-occurrence of chronic conditions,
  functional limitations, and/or geriatric syndromes. Aggressive care was based on
  claims-derived measures of receipt of cancer-directed treatment in the last two
  weeks of life; admission to the hospital and/or emergency department (ED) within
  the last month; and in-hospital death. We also identified patients enrolled in hospice.
  In multivariable logistic regression models, we analyzed the associations of interest,
  adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: While 61.2% of the patients enrolled
  in hospice, 24.6% underwent cancer-directed treatment; 55.1% were admitted to the
  hospital and/or ED; and 21.7% died in the hospital. We observed a U-shaped distribution
  between income and in-hospital death. Chronic conditions and geriatric syndromes
  were associated with some outcomes, but not with others. CONCLUSIONS: To improve
  quality end-of-life care and curtail costs incurred by dying patients, relevant
  interventions need to account for social determinants of health and MM in a nuanced
  fashion.'
