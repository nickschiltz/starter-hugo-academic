abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: Advances in highly active antiretroviral therapy have dramatically
  improved the lifespan of patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
  We sought to examine the impact of HIV status on outcomes in patients undergoing
  cardiovascular surgery. METHODS: We identified 5,621,817 patients who underwent
  coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), valve, aortic, or other cardiovascular surgery
  between 1998 and 2009 from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample. Of these, 9771 (0.17%)
  patients were seropositive for HIV. Using multivariable logistic regression modeling
  and 1:1 propensity-score matching, we determined the influence of HIV infection
  on outcomes. RESULTS: The percentage of HIV+ patients undergoing cardiovascular
  surgery increased significantly from 0.09% to 0.23%. HIV+ patients were more often
  male, black, younger than 55 years of age, and on Medicaid, and they were more likely
  to undergo valve and other cardiovascular surgeries, but less likely to have CABG.
  Among propensity-matched pairs, patients with HIV were at no increased risk for
  in-patient mortality. HIV+ patients were more likely to receive a blood transfusion
  and have any postoperative complication. Patients with HIV were less likely to have
  a postoperative stroke. Rates of pneumonia, renal complications, and wound infection
  were similar between the groups. The median length of stay and mean total cost were
  not different between the groups. Factors that predicted in-hospital death in HIV+
  patients included metastatic cancer, coagulopathy, renal failure, and aortic, other,
  or combined surgical procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiovascular surgery can be performed
  safely on patients with HIV with no increased hospital mortality and only minimal
  increased need for blood transfusion.'
