abstract: 'Objective: To characterize complex multimorbidity among cancer survivors
  and evaluate the association between cancer survivorship, time since cancer diagnosis,
  and self-reported fair/poor health, self-rated worse health in 2 years, and 2-year
  mortality. Methods: We used the 2010-2012 Health and Retirement Study. Cancer survivors
  were individuals who reported a (nonskin) cancer diagnosis 2 years or more before
  the interview. We defined complex multimorbidity as the co-occurrence of chronic
  conditions, functional limitations, and/or geriatric syndromes. In addition to descriptive
  analyses, we used logistic regression to evaluate the independent association between
  cancer survivor status and health outcomes. We also examined whether cancer survivorship
  differed by the number of years since diagnosis. Results: Among 15,808 older adults
  (age â‰¥50 years), 11.8% were cancer survivors. Compared with cancer-free individuals,
  a greater percentage of cancer survivors had complex multimorbidity: co-occurring
  chronic conditions, functional limitations, and geriatric syndromes. Cancer survivorship
  was significantly associated with self-reported fair/poor health, self-rated worse
  health in 2 years, and 2-year mortality. These effects declined with the number
  of years since diagnosis for fair/ poor health and mortality but not for self-rated
  worse health. Conclusion: Cancer survivor status is independently associated with
  more complex multimorbidity, and with worse health outcomes. These effects attenuate
  with time, except for patient perception of being in worse health.'
