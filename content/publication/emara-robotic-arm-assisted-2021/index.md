abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Technology-assisted knee arthroplasty (KA), including robotic-arm-assisted
  knee arthroplasty (RA-KA) and computer-assisted (CA-KA) knee arthroplasty, was developed
  to improve surgical accuracy of implant positioning and alignment, which may influence
  implant stability, longevity, and functional outcomes. However, despite increased
  adoption over the past decade; its value is still to be determined. QUESTIONS/PURPOSE:
  This study aimed to compare robotic-arm (RA)-KA, CA-KA, and manual (M)-KA regarding
  (1) in-hospital metrics (length of stay [LOS], discharge disposition, in-hospital
  complications, and hospitalization-episode costs), (2) characterize annual utilization
  trends, and (3) future RA-KA and CA-KA utilization projections. METHODS: National
  Inpatient Sample was queried for primary KAs (unicompartmental/total; 2008 to 2018).
  KAs were classified by modality (M-KA/CA-KA/RA-KA) using International Classification
  of Disease-9/10 codes. A propensity score-matched comparison of LOS, discharge disposition,
  in-hospital complications (implant-related mechanical or procedure-related nonmechanical
  complications), and costs was conducted. Trends and projected utilization rates
  were estimated. RESULTS: After propensity score matched to their respective M-KA
  cohorts, RA-KA and CA-KA exhibited shorter LOS (RA-KA versus M-KA: 2.0 ± 1.4 days
  versus 2.5 ± 1.8 days; P textless 0.001; CA-KA versus M-KA: 2.7 ± 1.4 days versus
  2.9 ± 1.6 days; P textless 0.001) and in-hospital implant-related mechanical complications
  (P textless 0.05, each). RA-KA demonstrated lower nonhome discharge (P textless
  0.001) and in-hospital procedure-related nonmechanical complications (P = 0.005).
  RA-KA had lower in-hospital costs ($16,881 ± 7,085 versus $17,320 ± 12,820; P textless
  0.001), whereas CA-KA exhibited higher costs ($18,411 ± 7,783 versus $17,716 ± 8,451;
  P textless 0.001). RA-KA utilization increased from textless0.1% in 2008 to 4.3%
  in 2018. CA-KA utilization rose temporarily to 6.2% in 2014, then declined to pre-2010
  levels in 2018 (4.5%). Projections indicate that RA-KA and CA-KA will represent
  49.9% (95% confidence interval, 41.1 to 59.9) and 6.2% (95% confidence interval,
  5.3% to 7.2%) of KAs by 2030. DISCUSSION: RA-KA may provide value through improving
  in-hospital metrics and mitigating net costs. Similar advantages may not be reliably
  attainable with CA-RA. Because RA-KA is projected to reach half of all knee arthroplasties
  done in the United States by 2030, further cost analyses and long-term studies are
  warranted.'
