abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Superior early pain control has been suggested with transversus
  abdominis plane blocks, but evidence-based recommendations for transversus abdominis
  plane blocks and their effects on patient outcomes are lacking. OBJECTIVE: The aim
  of this study was to determine whether transversus abdominis plane blocks improve
  early postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal resection
  already on an optimized enhanced recovery pathway. DESIGN: This study is based on
  a prospective, randomized, double-blind controlled trial. SETTINGS: The trial was
  conducted at a tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Patients undergoing elective
  laparoscopic colorectal resection were selected. INTERVENTIONS(S): Patients were
  randomly assigned to receive either a transversus abdominis plane block or a placebo
  placed intraoperatively under laparoscopic guidance. All followed a standardized
  enhanced recovery pathway. Patient demographics, perioperative procedures, and postoperative
  outcomes were collected. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Postoperative pain and nausea/vomiting
  scores in the postanesthesia care unit and department, opioid use, length of stay,
  and 30-day readmission rates were measured. RESULTS: The trial randomly assigned
  41 patients to the transversus abdominis plane block group and 38 patients to the
  control group. Demographic, clinical, and procedural data were not significantly
  different. In the postanesthesia care unit, the transversus abdominis plane block
  group had significantly lower pain scores (p textless 0.01) and used fewer opioids
  (p textless 0.01) than the control group; postoperative nausea/vomiting scores were
  comparable (p = 0.99). The transversus abdominis plane group had significantly lower
  pain scores on postoperative day 1 (p = 0.04) and throughout the study period (p
  textless 0.01). There was no significant difference between groups in postoperative
  opioid use (p = 0.65) or nausea/vomiting (p = 0.79). The length of stay (median,
  2 days experimental, 3 days control; p = 0.50) and readmission rate (7% experimental,
  5% control, p = 0.99) was similar across cohorts. LIMITATIONS: This study was conducted
  a single center. CONCLUSIONS: Transversus abdominis plane blocks improved immediate
  short-term opioid use and pain outcomes. Pain improvement was durable throughout
  the hospital stay. However, the blocks did not translate into less overall narcotic
  use, shorter length of stay, or lower readmission rates.'
