abstract: "OBJECTIVE: Evolving primary care models require methods to help practices\
  \ achieve quality standards. This study assessed the effectiveness of a Practice-Tailored\
  \ Facilitation Intervention for improving delivery of 3 pediatric preventive services.\
  \ METHODS: In this cluster-randomized trial, a practice facilitator implemented\
  \ practice-tailored rapid-cycle feedback/change strategies for improving obesity\
  \ screening/counseling, lead screening, and dental fluoride varnish application.\
  \ Thirty practices were randomized to Early or Late Intervention, and outcomes assessed\
  \ for 16â€‰419 well-child visits. A multidisciplinary team characterized facilitation\
  \ processes by using comparative case study methods. RESULTS: Baseline performance\
  \ was as follows: for Obesity: 3.5% successful performance in Early and 6.3% in\
  \ Late practices, P = .74; Lead: 62.2% and 77.8% success, respectively, P = .11;\
  \ and Fluoride: textless0.1% success for all practices. Four months after randomization,\
  \ performance rose in Early practices, to 82.8% for Obesity, 86.3% for Lead, and\
  \ 89.1% for Fluoride, all P textless .001 for improvement compared with Late practices'\
  \ control time. During the full 6-month intervention, care improved versus baseline\
  \ in all practices, for Obesity for Early practices to 86.5%, and for Late practices\
  \ 88.9%; for Lead for Early practices to 87.5% and Late practices 94.5%; and for\
  \ Fluoride, for Early practices to 78.9% and Late practices 81.9%, all P textless\
  \ .001 compared with baseline. Improvements were sustained 2 months after intervention.\
  \ Successful facilitation involved multidisciplinary support, rapid-cycle problem\
  \ solving feedback, and ongoing relationship-building, allowing individualizing\
  \ facilitation approach and intensity based on 3 levels of practice need. CONCLUSIONS:\
  \ Practice-tailored Facilitation Intervention can lead to substantial, simultaneous,\
  \ and sustained improvements in 3 domains, and holds promise as a broad-based method\
  \ to advance pediatric preventive care."
