abstract: "BACKGROUND: Disparity in resection rates for malignant brain tumors in\
  \ elderly patients is partially attributed to a belief that advanced age is associated\
  \ with an increased risk of postoperative morbidity and mortality. The objective\
  \ of this study was to investigate the effect of advanced age (≥75 years) on 30-day\
  \ outcomes in patients with primary and metastatic brain tumors who underwent craniotomy\
  \ for definitive resection of a malignant brain tumor. METHODS: The authors conducted\
  \ prospective analyses of the American College of Surgeons' National Surgical Quality-Improvement\
  \ Project (NSQIP) database from 2006 to 2010 of 970 patients aged ≥40 years who\
  \ underwent craniotomy for definitive resection of neoplasm. Preoperative and intraoperative\
  \ characteristics and 30-day outcomes were stratified by age. By using propensity\
  \ scores, 134 patients (aged ≥75 years) were matched to 134 patients ages 40 to\
  \ 74 years. Logistic regression was used to predict adverse postoperative outcomes.\
  \ RESULTS: The median length of hospital stay was 5 days; the rate of minor and\
  \ major complications were 5.9% and 13.1%, respectively; 5.7% of patients returned\
  \ to the operating room; and 4.3% of patients died within 30 days. Advanced age\
  \ did not increase the odds for poorer short-term outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Advanced\
  \ age did not increase the risk of poor outcomes after surgical resection of primary\
  \ or metastatic intracranial tumors when analyses were controlled for other risk\
  \ factors. These results suggest that age should not be used, in isolation, as an\
  \ a priori factor to discourage pursuing craniotomy."
