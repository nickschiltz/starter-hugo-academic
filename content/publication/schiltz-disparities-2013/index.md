abstract: "OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of individual and community characteristics\
  \ on access to specialized epilepsy care. METHODS: This retrospective cross-sectional\
  \ study analyzed data from the California State Inpatient Sample, the State Ambulatory\
  \ Surgery Database, and the State Emergency Department Database, that were linked\
  \ with the 2009 Area Resource File and the location of the National Association\
  \ of Epilepsy Center's epilepsy centers. The receipt of video-EEG monitoring was\
  \ measured and used to indicate access to specialized epilepsy care in subjects\
  \ with persistent seizures, identified as those who had frequent seizure-related\
  \ hospital admissions and/or ER visits. A hierarchical logistic regression model\
  \ was employed to assess barriers to high quality care at both individual and contextual\
  \ levels. RESULTS: Among 115,632 persons with persistent seizures, individuals who\
  \ routinely received care in an area where epilepsy centers were located were more\
  \ likely to have access to specialized epilepsy care (OR: 1.81, 95% CI: 1.20, 2.72).\
  \ Interestingly, the availability of epilepsy centers did not influence access to\
  \ specialized epilepsy care in people who had private insurance. In contrast, uninsured\
  \ individuals and those with public insurance programs including Medicaid and Medicare\
  \ had significant gaps in access to specialized epilepsy care. Other individual\
  \ characteristics such as age, race/ethnicity, and the presence of comorbid conditions\
  \ were also associated with disparities in access to specialized care in PWE. CONCLUSION:\
  \ Both individual and community characteristics play substantial roles in access\
  \ to high quality epilepsy care. Policy interventions that incorporate strategies\
  \ to address disparities at both levels are necessary to improve access to specialized\
  \ care for PWE."
