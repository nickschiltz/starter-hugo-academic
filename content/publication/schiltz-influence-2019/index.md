abstract: 'Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate the relationship of leading
  causes of death with gradients of cognitive impairment and multimorbidity. Method:
  This is a population-based study using data from the linked 1992-2010 Health and
  Retirement Study and National Death Index (n = 9,691). Multimorbidity is defined
  as a combination of chronic conditions, functional limitations, and geriatric syndromes.
  Regression trees and Random Forest identified which combinations of multimorbidity
  associated with causes of death. Results: Multimorbidity is common in the study
  population. Heart disease is the leading cause in all groups, but with a larger
  percentage of deaths in the mild and moderate/severe cognitively impaired groups
  than among the noncognitively impaired. The different \"paths\" down the regression
  trees show that the distribution of causes of death changes with different combinations
  of multimorbidity. Discussion: Understanding the considerable heterogeneity in chronic
  conditions, functional limitations, geriatric syndromes, and causes of death among
  people with cognitive impairment can target care management and resource allocation.'
