abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: To analyze trends in utilization of pre-surgical evaluations
  including video-EEG (VEEG) monitoring, intracranial EEG (IEEG) monitoring, and epilepsy
  surgery from 1998 to 2009 in the U.S. METHODS: Data from the Nationwide Inpatient
  Sample were used to identify admissions for pre-surgical evaluations and surgery.
  Surgical treatment of epilepsy was identified by the presence of primary ICD-9-CM
  procedure codes 01.52 (hemispherectomy), 01.53 (lobectomy), or 01.59 (other excision
  of the brain, including amygdalohippocampectomy). We calculated annual rates of
  pre-surgical evaluations and surgery based on published estimates of prevalence
  of epilepsy in the U.S. In addition, we examined variations by region and hospital
  characteristics, and conducted multivariable analysis to detect temporal trends,
  adjusting for changes in the population. Sensitivity analysis was also conducted
  using different algorithms to identify the study population and outcomes. RESULTS:
  We detected an increase in the rate of hospitalizations related to intractable epilepsy.
  Similarly, we noted a significant increase in hospitalizations for VEEG monitoring,
  but not in IEEG monitoring or in surgery. Multivariable analysis and sensitivity
  analysis confirmed these results. In addition, there was a significant increase
  in the proportion of pre-surgical evaluations and surgery performed in non-teaching
  hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the increase in VEEG monitoring, the availability
  of guideline and evidences demonstrating benefits of epilepsy surgery was not associated
  with a greater employment of surgery over time. Nevertheless, access to pre-surgical
  evaluations and epilepsy surgery is no longer limited to large medical centers.'
